# DBU-Final-Project
E-commerce Product Tracking, Analysis, and Visualization System


# Overview
This project provides an automated Python-based system for tracking and analyzing product information across multiple e-commerce platforms (Amazon and Best Buy). It scrapes product data (e.g., price, ratings) from these sites, processes it for analysis, and generates visualizations to assist with pricing and rating trend analysis.

## Key Features
Automated Data Collection: Scrapes product details (name, price, rating, category) from Amazon and Best Buy.

Data Cleaning & Processing: Removes duplicates, handles missing values, and standardizes price formats.

Data Analysis: Performs price distribution, rating trends analysis, and price comparison across different platforms.

Data Visualization: Generates boxplots and bar graphs for price distribution and pricing trends.

Automation: Schedules periodic scraping and analysis using the schedule library.

## Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Web Scraping Libraries: Selenium, WebDriver Manager

Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scheduling: schedule library

File Storage: CSV format for storing raw and processed data

Logging: Python's logging module
